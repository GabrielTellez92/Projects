# Addiction Habits and Profiles

The motivation of this analysis was to look at the addiction treatment practice through the data science perspective. Different interactions between 3 drug categories (depressants, hallucinogens, and stimulants) and 7 personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness, impulsivity, and sensation-seeking) were studied.
