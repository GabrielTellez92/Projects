# Addiction Habits and Profiles

## Introduction
The motivation of this analysis was to look at the addiction treatment practice through the data science perspective. Using psychological traits, various analytical models were built to help determine what personality traits indicate a higher risk of substance misuse that can lead to addiction. This analysis focuses on the different interactions between 3 categories of illicit drugs (depressants, hallucinogens, and stimulants) and 7 personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness, impulsivity, and sensation-seeking). The models compared for each of the 3 drug categories are logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine models. To examine the interactions for each category a step-AIC model was used. Included in this repository is this README file and a R code file with all the analysis done for this project.
