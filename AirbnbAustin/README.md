# Airbnb Analysis from Listings in Austin, TX

## Introduction
The objective of this project was to answer the following question: What should be considered when listing property with Airbnb in Austin, TX? In other words, what should a property owner pay more attention to when creating the profile of their property (i.e. property description, host description, pricing, neighborhood, geographical features)? Three wordclouds were constructed to show the most popular words used for three different sections (Location Name, About Host, Property Description) in a property profile page. A bar graph showing the top 10 words was also included with each wordcloud. Wordclouds and bar graphs were done in R. Data is publicly available and was obtained directly from the Airbnb site.
