# Flight On Time Analysis for DFW

## Introduction
The motivation for this project was to analyze the causes of aircraft delay due to its importance in airport operations and air decision-making. Air travel has become a popular choice of travel for leisure and business purposes. On-time flight performance is an important factor for airlines (to maintain current customers and attract new business), for retailers (i.e. traveling sites like Expedia or Priceline), and for travelers to make appropriate desicion-making. Due to the large scope of this subject, this analysis focuses on flights from the Dallas - Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), the busiest airport in Texas and 4th busiest airport in the world, and the data used spans from January 2017 until December 2017. The data includes only domestic flights and only observations with DFW as the origin airport were extracted. The data for this analysis is available from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).
